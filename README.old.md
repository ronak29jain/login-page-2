# login-page-2

This Project is the continuation of the "login-page" project. In "login-page", we have done login, signup, forgot password, account and home, on the same url (basically in a single home route). This project will use 'react-router-dom' to have different routes (pages) for signin, signup, account, home, etc. Later, We will also take our project in the forward by adding phone number signin and other login features.

This Project includes 2 additional pakages.

1. Firebase: to Install the firebase use command "npm i firebase"
2. react google button: To add this button run "npm i react-google-button" in the terminal.
